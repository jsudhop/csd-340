            <h3>An Autobiography by Leah</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="entry-autobiography">
            <p>Leah Moreno's life and personality is comprised of motivation infused with creativity and spite. It started even before she had the chance to cry herself into the world, and those surrounding her are sure to continue to see her blatant defiance of any limiting construct in her path. Her origin story begins with a doctor telling her mother to be prepared for the worst in August of 1994 in Kansas City, Missouri. Then, Leah and her twin had the audacity to enter the world trading heartbeats and breaths just so she could one day say I beat death as an infant.</p>
            
            <p>From that moment on, she became a collector of everything she was told she could never do based off the perspective and judgements of others. Those stances stemming from their concern for the medical condition's biology decided she needed. The primary suspects include seizures, under-developed organs, and trauma. However, as with most human spawns, the life of the parents also colored the image of a child's future. So, what did Leah do? She decided to knock the hurdles down instead of jumping them.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the accomplishments she has may seem insignificant and small. For example, having a job, being able to read at a more advanced level, not stuttering in most of her conversations, having a memory of her childhood - one she remembered on her own. All of which she was told she could never do or accomplish because of medically stated limitations.
            
            <p>A few on that list are simple life goals most of society reaches for but she only achieved out of spite. Owning a house is one such a goal she only added to her list of goals to thwart the wagging tongues of family. Graduating high school while working three jobs so the income could provide for her sibling's interests is also on that list.</p>
                  
            <p>The more exciting defying moments are when she took on soccer, taekwondo, sparring, aerial silks, gymnastics, archery, and jiu-jitsu. She pairs those with her proudest moments of having poetic works published either in online magazines or printed anthologies. The daring and delighted occasions are the ones she holds closest to her heart.</p>
            
            <p>Leah's life is by no means some outstanding adventure. There is no world record, scientific discovery, special and unique talent, or impressive school and work history. It is bull-headed, irrational, and even obsessive, but it speaks volumes of her diligence and passion to refuse to be constrained to the preferential cage others built her.</p>
