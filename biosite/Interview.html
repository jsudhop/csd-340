                <ul>
                    <li>What literary pilgrimages have you gone on?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">                        In a traditional sense, none. Most expectations for a literary pilgrimages is to be immersed in a favorite authors environment, observing destinations that remind you of the setting, or viewing artworks that remind you of the stories elements. The process is to help gain new perspectives on that favorite piece of yours. Most importantly, many of hoping to grasp the perspective of the writer. 
                        Literary pilgrimages take many forms and immersing yourself in the mind of the author is the most common. However, mine took the form of philosophical discussion by creating questions from the story itself, and gaining the perspective of complete strangers. Portions of the text would be posted followed by whatever question that scene inspired within my mind. Then, I would post the next section and ask if, how, and why their perspective on the topic changed. I started this whole process in middle school, because I had no way to financially afford visiting my list of favorite authors beginnings or ends. It created an entirely new impact on how I perceive casual and pleasurable reading.</span></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>What is the first book that made you cry?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">"Night" by Elie Wiesel. The horror of significant historical events is among the topics that shred my heart. I've written one poem that pay tribute to his work. It is written in a fashion that alternates between his words and mine:<br>
                        <br>
                        “On God’s Hands”<br>
                        <br>
                        "The race toward death had begun"<br>
                        Not one song could be sung<br>
                        "Windows looked out into the void"<br>
                        Hell's cruelty breaking us like toys<br>
                        "Hanging from the gallows..."<br>
                        That's how our fate had narrowed<br>
                        "One by one and offered our necks"<br>
                        Glazed eyes seeing only blood flecks<br>
                        "Tomorrow would be worst yet."<br>
                        Our future had been set.<br>
                        "Fire!"<br>
                        God... you liar<br>
                        <br>
                        </span></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Does writing energize or exhaust you?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">My writing style and how I start a piece is not very.... typical. Not in terms of poetry anyways. It starts with a huge burst of sudden energy and a jumble of words. I quickly jot them down in the most unorganized fashion one could possibly imagine. Then, it becomes a process I like to call "word tetras". Every word written down is fashioned into a poem. It's comparable to dumping a box of puzzle pieces and forming the image. The pieces are already there. I just fit them together. Despite how easy that sounds it's exhausting but refreshing.
                    </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>What is the most difficult part of your artistic process?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">Controlling it. My process is chaotic and it's not something I sit down and plan out. It strikes and I only have a small window of opportunity to utilize it. </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>You like to challenge readers with the rich vocabulary you use, is there any specific inspiration for that?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">Unfortunately not. It's apart of that Chaotic "word tetras" writing process I have. If anything, I would almost say my mind leans towards words that seem either beautiful or smooth. I don't "pick" the words. They're apart of the random bombardment that slips into my mind and I simply find a way to make them flow with the rest.</span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Does a big ego help or hurt writers?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">When I see the word ego I think of self-respect and self-worth. They hold the same or similar meanings, but one gets a bad rap because of the attitudes associated with it. So what's the context of the question? Do I think ego impairs the quality work they share? No. Do I think how they present themselves impairs it? No. Do I think ego affects how an audience views the writers work? Yes. Negatively or positively. It's entirely dependent on the reader's own perceptions and the associations they make between writer and work. </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>What is your writing Kryptonite?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">Topics that consist of strictly positive themes. I have a couple pieces that are geared to joyful elements. They are by no means my favorite, but I still take great pride in just being apart of creating something jovial. Especially when those pieces are accolades for two very precious treasures of mine. </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Did you ever consider writing under a pseudonym?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">I do for one particular genre I write. However, if I share it with you it wouldn't be much of an alias, now would it? </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Do you try more to be original or to deliver to readers what they want?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">My poems are always original. True to me and no other. My alias written work on the other had, now that's a specific service, and only performed to cater to the reader seeing as they're request pieces. </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Do you think someone could be a writer if they don't feel emotions strongly?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">Absolutely. In fact, most of the poetry I write is written while I enter a "numb state". In the moments I play "word tetras" I feel little to no emotion. It's pure concentration and dedication to the structuring and reorganizing of words.</span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>What other authors are you friends with, and how do they help you become a better writer?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">Mike Davidson is a fellow poet who uses a style called purple prose. I met him five years ago, but he's knew my younger brother for years before that. I've unwittingly worked his style into mine and it elevated the elements and essence of my work. He is also the only poet I've ever done a collaboration with. </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>What was the best money you ever spent as a writer?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">I purchased two anthologies I'm published in by Soul Poet Society. All of the royalties for their purchase go to charity. I plan on regularly submitting to them in order to be apart of the changes they help provide to a vast number of groups and communities. </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>What was an early experience where you learned that language had power?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">I learned in a single moment that both the absence of words and their presence have tremendous power. It ended with disciplinary stings of a switch from discontented grandparents, and the single most unifying moment of my life while preventing what would have been an inevitable end. </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Do you hide any secrets in your poems that only a few people will find?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">Yes, but not a single person I know can see past the overall concept or flamboyant vocabulary. </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Did you enjoy reading as a child?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">I didn't enjoy reading until late middle school. However, I was very swift in moving book to book so my instructors had trouble keeping me entertained and within school reading regulations. Reading assignments like Ender's Game, Frankenstein, Animal Farm, Brave New World, Inferno, and Iliad were given to me in early middle school, and they'd be finished in a matter of a couple days. One day, talking to a senile philosophical man it clicked how much I enjoy immersing myself in these written worlds. I hadn't realized how many significant questions could be found each story. Not just the generic, school based questions but real significant inquiries including concepts of  existence, value, language, mind, religion, and on and on. </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Tell me more about your dress making please.<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">The dress making is a long process, but it's an enriching bonding experience. The end result is just a beautiful as selecting the materials. I always choose the same regalia to create: the jingle dress. The jingle dress regalia is often associated with healing due to its origin. There are a variety of options to make the jingle dress and for me there is an assigned significance in every selection, from the colors and fabric to the rows of metal pieces, and the sound they make. I have a lot of healing I want to dance into this world, among family, for friends, and wished upon those who have walked on. </span><br></li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>You do archery, have you ever 'robinhooded' an arrow or come close?<br></li><br>
                    <li><span class="cursive">I actually haven't even tried! I have loved performing complex, but far less legendary archery shots. Most of which combines gymnastics and/or bikes. </span><br></li>
