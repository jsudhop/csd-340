<!--Lots of divs in this assignment, I had originally named all the 'div id's as such, but then i switched to 'div class'... not entirely sure why as it was something I read, but then i switched back.
I looked around again and I found it in the book, page 376.  They do 'div class' there, but I found 'div id' with the css style i used worked for what I wanted so I just decided to stick with that.-->
